Predicting Default of Credit Card Clients 
Defaulting occurs when a cardholder fails to make the required minimum payment on their credit card account within the specified time frame. This can lead to various consequences, such as fees, increased interest rates, negative impacts on credit scores, and potential legal actions by the credit card issuer to recover the debt.

Credit card defaults have risen by Rs 951 crore, to Rs 4,073 crore in FY23 from Rs 3,122 crore in FY22, according to data obtained from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
